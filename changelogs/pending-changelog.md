## Summary

<!-- Append your summary here -->

Timestamps are now kept as integer microseconds. Every `timestamp` argument still takes float seconds, and the SDK rounds it once to microseconds. Logged samples, stored traces and synchronized data carry `timestamp_us` beside `timestamp`, and `timestamp` is the same instant rounded to the microsecond. The SDK now needs pydantic 2.12 or later. Two timestamps that round to the same microsecond on one stream are rejected as not increasing, and a timestamp that is not finite or is out of range raises `ValueError`.
